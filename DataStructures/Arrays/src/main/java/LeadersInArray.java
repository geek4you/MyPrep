/**
 * @link http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/leaders-in-an-array/
 * Write a program to print all the LEADERS in the array. An element is leader if it is greater than all the elements
 * to its right side. And the rightmost element is always a leader. For example int the array {16, 17, 4, 3, 5, 2},
 * leaders are 17, 5 and 2.
 *
 * Scan all the elements from right to left in array and keep track of maximum till now. When maximum changes
 * itâ€™s value, print it.
