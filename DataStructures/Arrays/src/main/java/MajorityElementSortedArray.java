 * Check for Majority Element in a sorted array
 *
 * Question: Write a C function to find if a given integer x appears more than n/2 times in a sorted array of n integers.

 Basically, we need to write a function say isMajority() that takes an array (arr[] ), arrayâ€™s size (n) and a number
 to be searched (x) as parameters and returns true if x is a majority element (present more than n/2 times).

 Examples:

 Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 10}, x = 3
 Output: True (x appears more than n/2 times in the given array)

 Input: arr[] = {1, 1, 2, 4, 4, 4, 6, 6}, x = 4
 Output: False (x doesn't appear more than n/2 times in the given array)

 Input: arr[] = {1, 1, 1, 2, 2}, x = 1
 Output: True (x appears more than n/2 times in the given array)
