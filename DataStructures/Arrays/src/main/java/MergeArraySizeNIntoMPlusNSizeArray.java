 * Merge an array of size n into another array of size m+n
 *
 * There are two sorted arrays. First one is of size m+n containing only m elements.
 * Another one is of size n and contains n elements. Merge these two arrays into the first array of size m+n such that
 * the output is sorted.
 *
 * Input: array with m+n elements (mPlusN[]).
 * 2 N/A 7 N/A N/A 10 N/A
 *
 * NA => Value is not filled/available in array
 *
 * Input: array with n elements (N[])
 * 5 8 12 14
 *
 * Output: N[] merged into mPlusN[] (Modified mPlusN[])
 *
 * 2 5 7 8 10 12 14
 *
 * Let first array be mPlusN[] and other array be N[]
1) Move m elements of mPlusN[] to end.
2) Start from nth element of mPlusN[] and 0th element of N[] and merge them
into mPlusN[].
