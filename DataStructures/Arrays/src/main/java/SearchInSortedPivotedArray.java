/**
 * @link: Search an element in a sorted and pivoted array
 * Question:
 * An element in a sorted array can be found in O(log n) time via binary search. But suppose I rotate the sorted array at
 * some pivot unknown to you beforehand. So for instance, 1 2 3 4 5 might become 3 4 5 1 2. Devise a way to find an
 * element in the rotated array in O(log n) time.
 * <p>
 * 3   4   5   2  1
 * <p>
 * Find the pivot point, divide the array in two sub-arrays and call binary search.
 * The main idea for finding pivot is â€“ for a sorted (in increasing order) and pivoted array, pivot element is the only
 * only element for which next element to it is smaller than it.
 * Using above criteria and binary search methodology we can get pivot element in O(logn) time
 * <p>
 * Input arr[] = {3, 4, 5, 1, 2}
 * Element to Search = 1
 * 1) Find out pivot point and divide the array in two
 * sub-arrays. (pivot = 2) //Index of 5
 * 2) Now call binary search for one of the two sub-arrays.
 * (a) If element is greater than 0th element then
 * search in left array
 * (b) Else Search in right array
 * (1 will go in else as 1 < 0th element(3))
 * 3) If element is found in selected sub-array then return index
 * Else return -1.
