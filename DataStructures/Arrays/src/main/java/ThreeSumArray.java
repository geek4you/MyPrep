/**
 * Find a triplet that sum to a given value
 * Given an array and a value, find if there is a triplet in array whose sum is equal to the given value.
 * If there is such a triplet present in array, then print the triplet and return true. Else return false.
 * For example, if the given array is {12, 3, 4, 1, 6, 9} and given sum is 24, then there is a triplet (12, 3 and 9)
 * present in array whose sum is 24.
 * <p>
 * A simple method is to generate all possible triplets and compare the sum of every triplet with the given value.
 * The following code implements this simple method using three nested loops.
 * <p>
 * Time complexity of the method 1 is O(n^3). The complexity can be reduced to O(n^2) by sorting the array first, and then using method 1 of this post in a loop.
 * 1) Sort the input array.
 * 2) Fix the first element as A[i] where i is from 0 to array size â€“ 2. After fixing the first element of triplet,
