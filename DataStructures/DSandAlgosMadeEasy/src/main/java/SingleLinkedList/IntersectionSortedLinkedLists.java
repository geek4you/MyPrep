/**
 * Given two lists sorted in increasing order, create and return a new list representing the intersection of the two lists.
 * The new list should be made with its own memory â€” the original lists should not be changed.

 For example, let the first linked list be 1->2->3->4->6 and second linked list be 2->4->6->8, then your function should
 create and return a third list as 2->4->6.
