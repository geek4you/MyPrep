/**
 * Given arrival and departure time of employees in an office. Find the maximum no of chairs needed so that at no
 * instance, an employee has to stand.
 *
 *
 * Example-
 Input-
 5.00 6.00 7.00
 6.30 7.00 8.00
 Output-2
 It is similar to this http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimum-number-platforms-required-railwaybus-station/.
 The main thing in this question was reading the input as number of employees was not given beforehand.
 It was also asked to check for all INVALID inputs and return -1 in those cases.
