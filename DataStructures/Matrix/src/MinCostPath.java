/**Given a cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][], write a function that returns cost of minimum cost path 
to reach (m, n) from (0, 0). Each cell of the matrix represents a cost to traverse through that cell. 
Total cost of a path to reach (m, n) is sum of all the costs on that path (including both source and destination). 
You can only traverse down, right and diagonally lower cells from a given cell, i.e., 
from a given cell (i, j), cells (i+1, j), (i, j+1) and (i+1, j+1) can be traversed. 
You may assume that all costs are positive integers.*/


//another question similar to the above question
/*There is a N*N integer matrix Arr[N][N]. From the row r and column c, we can go to any of the following three indices:

I.                Arr[ r+1 ][ c-1 ] (valid only if c-1>=0)

II.               Arr[ r+1 ][ c ]

III.              Arr[ r+1 ][ c+1 ] (valid only if c+1<=N-1)

So if we start at any column index on row 0, what is the largest sum of any of the paths till row N-1.*/
