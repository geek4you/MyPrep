/**
 * Print a Binary Tree in Vertical Order | Set 1
 Given a binary tree, print it vertically. The following example illustrates vertical order traversal.

 1
 /    \
 2      3
 / \    / \
 4   5  6   7
 \   \
 8   9


 The output of print this tree vertically will be:
 4
 2
 1 5 6
 3 8
 7
 9

 sol: use hashmap(HashMap<horizontalDist,LinkedList>  and store all the nodes for the vertical height
 print them
